## ✅  Restaurant Recommendation System for CDLU Students

> 👋 *“I'd like to walk you through a full-stack project I developed, which combines frontend development, backend APIs, and a recommendation engine to solve a real-world student problem.”*

---

### 🧠 **Project Overview: What & Why?**

The project is a **Restaurant Recommendation Website** designed specifically for students of **JCD, Sirsa**.

It’s aimed at helping **first- and second-year students**—especially those who are new to the city—discover restaurants around the college that match their **personal preferences** such as cuisine, affordability, and distance.

Rather than relying on generic apps or manually browsing Google Maps and reviews, students can log in to our platform, get **personalized suggestions**, view menus, read **peer feedback**, and even contribute their own reviews.

### 👨‍💻 **My Role: Full-Stack Developer**

I played the role of a **full-stack developer**, which meant I was responsible for:

* Designing and building the **frontend user interface**
* Developing the **backend logic and REST APIs**
* Managing the **database schema and data flow**
* Supporting integration of the **recommendation engine**
* Handling **testing and deployment**

---

### ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (fully responsive and mobile-friendly)
* **Backend**: Spring Boot with RESTful APIs
* **Database**: MySQL
* **Machine Learning (Team Collaboration)**: Used to deliver real-time, personalized recommendations
* **Testing**: Manual + automated testing for functionality, performance, and security

---

### 🚀 **Key Features**

1. **Login & User Profiles**

   * Users can register and log in to access their preferences, saved places, and reviews.

2. **Search & Smart Filters**

   * Students can search for restaurants by cuisine, price, or distance from campus.

3. **Personalized Recommendations**

   * ML model suggests restaurants based on previous interactions and preferences.

4. **Live Menus & Details**

   * Access menus, pricing, contact info, and images — all centralized in one place.

5. **Peer Reviews & Ratings**

   * Students can rate restaurants and write reviews to help others make better choices.

6. **Community & Feedback**

   * Crowdsourced feedback enhances recommendation accuracy over time.

### 🧪 **Testing Efforts**

As part of development, I ensured comprehensive testing in all major categories:

#### ✅ 1. **Functionality Testing**

* Validated login, registration, search results, and feedback submissions.

#### ✅ 2. **Usability Testing**

* Focused on UI responsiveness across mobile/desktop.
* Collected feedback from test users to improve layout and navigation.

#### ✅ 3. **Performance Testing**

* Measured loading speed and responsiveness across multiple restaurant pages.
* Simulated traffic to test how well the backend and database scaled.

#### ✅ 4. **Integration Testing**

* Ensured seamless data flow between frontend, backend, and ML model.
* Verified API correctness and response consistency.

#### ✅ 5. **Security Testing**

* Implemented input validation and basic encryption.
* Checked for vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

### 💡 **Why This Matters – Real-World Impact**

* New students often **don’t know the area**, and waste a lot of time picking a restaurant. This platform cuts that time down to minutes.
* The system allows them to rely on their **peer community’s reviews**, not just random public reviews.
* Because it’s **mobile-optimized**, they can use it on the go without any technical training.
* It also gives **restaurants visibility** among students, helping them engage with a local audience.

---

### 🧠 **What I Learned**

* Deep understanding of **frontend-backend communication**
* How to design systems for **real user needs** and usability
* Experience in integrating a **recommendation engine** with user profiles
* Real-world testing practices: **security, performance, and UX**
* Importance of community feedback in building smarter systems
